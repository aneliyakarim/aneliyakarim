### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aneliya Mukhamedkarimova. I am a marketer with experience in finance, textile, automobile, and adverting industries. I specialize on marketing strategy and product development. Love to share my knowledge and improve processes. 
Today I study app development in the Apple Developer Academy for three reasons:
1) to provide better learning experience to my students,
2) to develop products people will enjoy,
3) to live my life doing what I love.
